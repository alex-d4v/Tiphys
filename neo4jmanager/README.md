# Neo4j Manager (Python Interface)

The `neo4jmanager/` module provides a high-level abstraction for interacting with the Neo4j graph database. It handles connection pooling, schema initialization, and standard task-based operations.

## Components
- `manager.py`: Connects to Neo4j using the provided credentials (via `.env`) and creates indexes and constraints.
- `task_operations.py`: Implementation of CRUD, similarity search, and graph traversal algorithms.

## Features
- **Node Type**: `Task` (id, description, date, time, priority, status, started_at, ended_at, embedding).
- **Relationship Type**: `DEPENDS_ON` (maps dependencies between tasks).
- **Vector Search**: Performs similarity queries using embeddings generated by the LLM. 
- **Time Range Search**: Allows filtering tasks within a specific temporal window (radius search).
- **Dependency Paths**: Shows the chain of tasks required to complete a given goal.

## Example Usage
```python
from neo4jmanager.manager import Neo4jManager
from neo4jmanager.task_operations import TaskOperations

with Neo4jManager() as db:
    db.initialize_schema()
    ops = TaskOperations(db)
    # Perform task operations...
```
